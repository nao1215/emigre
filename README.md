# [WIP] emigre - Self-hosted image sharing social media
emigre is a self-hosted server and client that mimics an image posting service. The purpose of developing Emigre is to validate technology stacks that are not used in the company that I belong to. In other words, satisfying technical interests is more important than creating a popular service.


Emigre is expected to be implemented using the following technologies:
- Server-side: Golang
- Infrastructure: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Client-side: Android application

# What does Emigre mean?
The Emigre is derived from the Emigre document in SHADOW HEART (it is game game developed for the PlayStation 2). The Emigre document describes a secret technique that overcomes death and creates new life from nothingness. I write code out of technical interest, however I also desire for the software to endure.
