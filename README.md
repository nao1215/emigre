# emigre - Self-hosted image sharing social media
**work in progress**  
  
Emigre is an image sharing service aiming to be a decentralized social networking platform based on ActivityPub. Currently, it is in the design phase and has very few functionalities.   

Emigre is being developed to satisfy the technical interests of the developer (myself). Specifically, the goal is to develop it by distancing oneself from the frameworks and libraries used in work.

## Contribution
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! Contributions are not only related to development. For example, GitHub Star motivates me to develop! 
  
The emigre is a service that incurs infrastructure costs. While still in the development stage, I am actively seeking financial support from those who are willing. Any funds received will be utilized entirely for covering infrastructure expenses.

## Special Thanks
![localstack](./docs/images/localstack-readme-banner.svg)
[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/) is a service that mocks AWS, covering a wide range of AWS services. It is not easy to set up an AWS infrastructure for personal development, but LocalStack has lowered the barrier for server application development.   

It has been incredibly helpful for my technical learning, and among the open-source software (OSS) I encountered in 2023, LocalStack is undoubtedly the best tool. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.

## What does Emigre mean?
The Emigre is derived from the Emigre document in SHADOW HEART (it is game game developed for the PlayStation 2). The Emigre document describes a secret technique that overcomes death and creates new life from nothingness. I write code out of technical interest, however I also desire for the software to endure.
